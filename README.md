We will utilize AI to create a sports commentary data analytics generator using LLM and voice recognition. The basic idea is to feed the AI past box score data and ask to consistently output the same structure that an algorithm can use.

As part of our application, users will be asked to speak into their computer, and an AI voice-to-language model will listen and convert that audio into text.  Finally, that will give input into a prebuilt LLM, which will then return a specific data visualization for what the user says.

This application will be built using Python and will rely on tools such as pre-built models: LLM API's for AI components, whisper for voice to language. We can also create a user interface on top of the system to create a seamless user experience while using this tool.
